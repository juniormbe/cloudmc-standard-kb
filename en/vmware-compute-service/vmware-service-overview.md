## Summary

CloudMC allows cloud operators to access and manage infrastructure and resources that have been deployed on a VMware Cloud Director service delivery platform. This article will introduce basic concepts of VMware and working with VMWare Cloud Director resources in CloudMC.

## Detailed overview

VMware Cloud Director enables enterprises to build private clouds and datacenters, which can be used to deploy cloud-based applications. CloudMC provides a unified interface to access a VMware platform and other services from a single portal. Through CloudMC, users can manage:

-   [Networks](vmware-networking.md)
-   [Virtual machines](vmware-virtual-machines.md)
-   [Virtual applications](vmware-virtual-applications.md)
-   [Storage](vmware-storage.md)

Because CloudMC acts as a portal to VMware Cloud Director services, you may find that some operations appear to behave differently than when interacting with VMware directly. However, behind the scenes, all operations execute exactly as they normally would. Changes made to VMware entities in CloudMC will be reflected immediately in the actual resources.
